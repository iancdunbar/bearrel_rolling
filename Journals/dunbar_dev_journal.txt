			re-examine the need for physics.

1:48 - Song Of Solomon - Animals as Leaders

	 - Just returned from the morning meeting with Jared, Michael, and Rob where we discussed getting
	 the game back in line with our original vision and making it a project we all want to work on. I
	 think we accomplished that mission with the changes we came up with.
	 - I am now going to write up a design document to solidify these changes and provide us with a
	 reference to use in the future for both production and discussion. This is something we needed
	 to do sooner.
