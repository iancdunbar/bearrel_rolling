1:30pm - Set up the github project with the project files that I have been working on.
		- Basic controls and physics are in
		- Next will work on creating a more official character controller, and potentially
			re-examine the need for physics.

1:48pm - Song Of Solomon - Animals as Leaders

	 - Just returned from the morning meeting with Jared, Michael, and Rob where we discussed getting
	 the game back in line with our original vision and making it a project we all want to work on. I
	 think we accomplished that mission with the changes we came up with.
	 - I am now going to write up a design document to solidify these changes and provide us with a
	 reference to use in the future for both production and discussion. This is something we needed
	 to do sooner.

3:06pm - Isolated Incidents - Animals as Leaders
	
	- Done with the initial pass on the GDD, but there is much left to do to fully flesh out the document.
	But for now I must go work on the truck while I still have good light.
	
9:33pm - Air Chrysalis - Animals as Leaders

	- Post dinner and post nap and its time to do some more work on the design doc. 
	
10:15pm - Survival - Sleeping In Gethsemane

	- The first pass of the GDD is done, while it could still use more work I will wait to get some feedback
	on it before doing so.
	- Now it is time to do a little bit of exploration with the controls of the bear. I will start by writing an
	Input dispatch class that will abstract the controls away from the other bear scripts. This should be a 
	simple class for now that will look for keyboard input and send one of five messages.
	
11:52pm - Animate-Inanimate - John Petrucci

	- Well I only managed to write a single simple follow script for the camera and merely begin the 
	InputDispatch (which in hindsight is a tad unnecessary at this point). I ended up getting engrossed
	in tracking down posts made by a rather foul gamergater. Anyway, its off to bed and hopefully tomorrow
	I will be able to implement basic Impulse controls.
	
12:30am - Game Development - The Romero ( Whatever song is playing in Dangerous Dave )

	- Seeing the John was streaming DD development has motivated me to do more work on the bear! At this
	point rudimentary impulse controls are in. Control is very sketchy and jumpy however, not surprising because
	I put in almost no time to implement it.
	- It is worth evaluating if we need to use unity's collisions and physics for the impulses. The precise 
	constraints on the motion need to be established and then we can decide from there if we need the physics.
	Though since we will be using them for the ragdoll do we need to be using them for the movement as well? 
	Needs to be thought through and figured out.
