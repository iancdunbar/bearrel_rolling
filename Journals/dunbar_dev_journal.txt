1:30pm - Set up the github project with the project files that I have been working on.
		- Basic controls and physics are in
		- Next will work on creating a more official character controller, and potentially
			re-examine the need for physics.

1:48pm - Song Of Solomon - Animals as Leaders

	 - Just returned from the morning meeting with Jared, Michael, and Rob where we discussed getting
	 the game back in line with our original vision and making it a project we all want to work on. I
	 think we accomplished that mission with the changes we came up with.
	 - I am now going to write up a design document to solidify these changes and provide us with a
	 reference to use in the future for both production and discussion. This is something we needed
	 to do sooner.

3:06pm - Isolated Incidents - Animals as Leaders
	
	- Done with the initial pass on the GDD, but there is much left to do to fully flesh out the document.
	But for now I must go work on the truck while I still have good light.
	
9:33pm - Air Chrysalis - Animals as Leaders

	- Post dinner and post nap and its time to do some more work on the design doc. 
	
10:15pm - Survival - Sleeping In Gethsemane

	- The first pass of the GDD is done, while it could still use more work I will wait to get some feedback
	on it before doing so.
	- Now it is time to do a little bit of exploration with the controls of the bear. I will start by writing an
	Input dispatch class that will abstract the controls away from the other bear scripts. This should be a 
	simple class for now that will look for keyboard input and send one of five messages.
	
11:52pm - Animate-Inanimate - John Petrucci

	- Well I only managed to write a single simple follow script for the camera and merely begin the 
	InputDispatch (which in hindsignt is a tad unnessicary at this point). I ended up getting engrossed
	in tracking down posts made by a rather foul gamergater. Anyway, its off to bed and hopefully tomorrow
	I will be able to implement basic Impulse controls.
